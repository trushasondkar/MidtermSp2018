# Spring 2018 TRGN510 Midterm

*Please replace your name with your name on line 6 above in author
** Due 2/27/18 by 12:00PM Pacific Time Zone **

This is an R Markdown document and your exam. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Please EMAIL ME the Readme.Rmd file to turn it on - davidwcr@usc.edu.  This will be your completed exam.

There are different types of questions.  The first are multiple choice, fill in blank or true false.  The second are code block.Please edit the markdown such by either (1) striking *italicized* words that are incorrect using ~~strikethrough~~ (\~\~strikethrough\~\~), (2) deleting the incorrect *italicized* terms, or (3) putting the correct answer where requested.

See below for an example.  We see that both _true_ and _false_ are options.  To answer the question, we delete _false_

## Example 1

**Before the exam**

* It is __true__ __false__ that the earth is round and the average temperature of the earth has risen within our lifetime

**After you edited by deleting __false__ or crossing it out, any one of these is ok **

* It is __true__ that the earth is round and the average temperature of the earth has risen within our lifetime
* It is __true__ ~~_false_~~ that the earth is round and the average temperature of the earth has risen within our lifetime

## Example 2 - Codeblock edit

How would I list the files in my home directory, ordered by size such that the lowest size are at the bottom, and print the size of the files in a human readable format listing on the last 10 lines?

* In this you would start with an empty codeblock, and then you would edit it so that correct commands work within R.

Before:

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo "I haven't answered and so this comment is here"
```

After
```{bash, echo = FALSE}
ls -lSh ~ | tail
```

## Types of data (any language): 14 points

* "2" is a __String__ datatype.
* 2 is a __Integer__ datatype.
* 2.05 is an __Float__ datatype.
* 3.0 is an __Float__ datatype.
* "" is an __String__ datatype.
* "false" is an __String__ datatype.
* TRUE is an __Boolean__ datatype.

## Types of data (R): 16 points

* When we run the command *a<-c("d",1,"b")* in *R*, creates a __array__ stored in *a*.

* After we create a variable *a* and fill it with data using the command a<-c("d",1,"b"), we can subset to *d<-a[2]*.  The type of data found in *d* is of type __string__.

* Put within the code block a command for loading in the ggplot2 library.  You may have to install.packages first - I do not expect that in the code block.  Then put in a command that creates a dataframe called "diamonds_dataframe" using the diamond function.  Then put in a command that prints out the mean of the price.  The code block should have around 3 lines - but as long as the mean of the price is provided, it is correct even with fewer lines

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
summary(diamonds)
mean(diamonds$price)
```

If you were to load in the diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 library, what type of data is found within diamonds$carat?

>  __Float__

* Please make a violin plot from the diamond dataset where the X-axis is "cut" and Y-axis is "price"

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, y=price))+geom_violin()
```



*These questions may involve concepts that you don't know exactly because the point is to be
able to solve new qeuestions.  Thus to an extent you are expected to may need a little research.*

* csv files are typically __comma__ deliminited

* The data below is typically __json__

> data ={
        name: "John",
        address: {
            street: "459 E Jon St.",
            city: "Springfield,
            state: "Illinois",
        },
        age:14
    }

* In the example above, data.age is __Integer__ data-type

## Licenses (12 Points)
*If you feel you want to qualify your answer, you are allowed to add some assumptions and I'll accept it.  This is not needed though*

* It is __True__, If I published my old code working under an MIT license, I can  at my new I can utilize that code within a new application without asking for written permission from my prior employer provided I acknowledge the prior copyrights.

* It is __True__, I can include code from my prior company that was put out open within GNU GPLv3 embedded within a new project at a new company provided I acknowledge the prior copyrights within a commercial software within the App store.

* It is __True__, I didn't put a license file in my code but I posted it on github while working in a research laboratory. Because of my lack of thoroughness, I forgot the license file.  I can still use it because its free of all licenses

Above - the markdown asterisk is just to show you that its on its own line. Please don't put the astrisk in the file.

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
vim numbers.txt
```
Now exit the file and type:

```{bash, echo = FALSE}
echo 1234 > numbers.txt; echo 12121 >> numbers.txt; echo 3434 >> numbers.txt; echo 123 >> numbers.txt; echo 12341239879 >> numbers.txt
